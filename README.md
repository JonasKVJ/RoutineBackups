# Usage
Python script that backs up a predefined set of folders into a specified location. For anyone using the script: replacer folder_X with the desired variable names and replace the part where it says /Insert/PathX/Here with the paths to the folders that need to be backed up. The script might need to be run with the Python3 backupToZip.py command before being executed, as Python backupToZip.py will run the pre-installed Python on MacOS. Only Python 3 is compatible. 
The folders will be backed up into a zip file located at the same location as the script.
